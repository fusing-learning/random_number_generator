1. Changed Allow Duplications and Sort the Results from dropdown list to exposed multiple choice (all choices are listed horizontally, user just needs to click one of them to select them, the selected value has a black dot next to them)
2. Can we make it so that if Allow Duplications is on, if there is only one number doesn't have a frequency assigned to it yet (value 0), it would automatically get updated to the remaining total, eg allow duplications, generate 10 numbers, limits 1-3, so once user assigned 3 & 4, since the remainder now is 3, 3 should be automatically populated on the last nunmber
3. Add Range Limit: Prevent performance issues by limiting range to 200 numbers when duplications are enabled
4. Input Validation: Add proper validation for decimals, negatives, and invalid ranges
5. Add Utility Buttons: "Fill All" and "Clear All" buttons for duplication controls   
6. Mobile Responsiveness: Improve layout for mobile devices
